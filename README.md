  ## Description
  The Team Profile Generator is a convenient way to generate an aesthetically pleasing and simple HTML-based profile for your team. It will ask for the manager's information and then either an intern or engineer's information. From there on, you can add another intern/engineer and continue doing so. Then, a team.html file will be created for you and each employee will have their own card with their respective information. All emails are linked to open an email sent to that address and GitHub usernames are linked to their profile.

  ## Usage
